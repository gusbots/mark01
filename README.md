# Mark 01 - The study robot

I am putting together this robot as part of my first robotics project. A robot with I can study multiple common problems in robotics like localization, navigation, hardware, ROS, image processing, control theory, and much more.

Mark 01 is a differential robot that uses a Raspberry PI as the main source of processing.

# Software dependencies

If you are using a old version of Raspberry PI OS you may need to install pygame.

sudo pip3 install pygame

And this project will be followed by a sequence of YouTube videos.
